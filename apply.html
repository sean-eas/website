        <h1>Trustee Opportunity – Elijah’s Animal Sanctuary</h1>
        <h2>About Elijah’s Animal Sanctuary</h2>
        <p>Elijah’s Animal Sanctuary is a small, values-led charity providing lifelong sanctuary care for animals who cannot be rehomed. Every animal in our care is offered safety, dignity and compassion for the rest of their lives.</p>
        <p>The sanctuary was founded in 2022 by Sean and Becca, named after their Son Elijah who was sadly born sleeping in 2019. The sanctuary is Elijah’s legacy and is rooted in kindness, integrity and responsible stewardship. As we continue to grow, we are focused on building strong foundations that ensure the charity remains sustainable, ethical and well-governed for the long term.</p>

        <h2>The Role</h2>
        <p>We are looking to appoint a new Trustee to join our Board and help guide the future of Elijah’s Animal Sanctuary.</p>
        <p>Trustees are volunteers who work collectively to ensure the charity is well run, financially sustainable and always acting in its best interest.</p>
        <p>This is <strong>not</strong> a day-to-day operational or hands-on animal care role.</p>

        <h2>Minimum Time Commitment</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Four trustee meetings per year, each lasting approximately 2 hours</li>
          <li>Around 4 hours per month supporting the charity outside of meetings</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Meetings are primarily held in person in Mirfield, West Yorkshire so being local or willing to travel to Mirfield is essential.</p>

          <li>Share our values and understand the importance of lifelong sanctuary care</li>
          <li>Thoughtful, collaborative and comfortable contributing to strategic discussions</li>
          <li>Willing to take on the legal responsibilities of a trustee</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You do <strong>not</strong> need prior trustee experience. We care more about integrity, judgement and a willingness to learn.</p>

          <li>Be aged 18 or over</li>
          <li>Be eligible to act as a charity trustee under Charity Commission rules</li>
